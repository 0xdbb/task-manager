## Scaling to Millions of Users

To handle millions of users and tasks, the system is designed with scalability as a core principle. Below are strategies to ensure performance, reliability, and maintainability at scale:

- **Database**:
  - **Sharding**: Partition the `tasks` table by `user_id` to distribute data across multiple PostgreSQL instances, reducing contention and improving write performance. Use a consistent hashing mechanism to map tasks to shards.
  - **Read Replicas**: Deploy read replicas to offload high read volume (e.g., status polling) from the primary database, ensuring low latency for users. Synchronize replicas with the primary using PostgreSQL’s streaming replication.
  - **Indexing**: Optimize with composite indexes on `(user_id, status)` and `(priority, created_at)` for frequent queries, balancing read/write trade-offs.

- **Queue**:
  - **RabbitMQ Clustering**: Scale RabbitMQ horizontally by deploying a cluster with mirrored queues across nodes, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. Use a load balancer to distribute producer/consumer traffic.
  - **Kafka Alternative**: For even higher throughput and durability, consider migrating to Apache Kafka. Kafka’s partitioned topics and consumer groups would allow parallel task processing at scale, with built-in retention for auditing.
  - **Monitoring**: Implement queue depth monitoring (e.g., via RabbitMQ’s management plugin or Kafka’s metrics) to detect bottlenecks and trigger scaling actions.

- **Workers**:
  - **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy workers as a Kubernetes Deployment with multiple replicas, auto-scaling based on queue depth (e.g., using KEDA with RabbitMQ queue length as a metric). This ensures workers dynamically adjust to workload spikes.
  - **Resource Allocation**: Assign CPU/memory limits per worker pod to optimize resource usage, preventing overload during peak traffic.
  - **Task Prioritization**: Enhance workers to process high-priority tasks first by consuming from priority-specific queues, improving user experience for critical tasks.

- **API**:
  - **Load Balancing**: Use NGINX as a reverse proxy to distribute HTTP requests across multiple API instances, ensuring even load and failover. Configure sticky sessions if needed for WebSocket upgrades.
  - **Caching**: Integrate Redis to cache task statuses and frequently accessed user data (e.g., TTL of 30 seconds), reducing database load. Use Redis Pub/Sub for future real-time enhancements.
  - **Rate Limiting**: Enforce API throttling (e.g., via NGINX or `gin` middleware) to protect against abuse, setting higher limits for authenticated users based on role (e.g., admins get priority).

- **Microservices**:
  - **Monolith to Microservices**: Transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices to decouple components (e.g., authentication, task management, worker processing). This allows independent scaling—workers might need more CPU, while the API might need more memory—and simplifies updates.
  - **Service Boundaries**: Define services like `auth-service`, `task-service`, and `worker-service`, communicating via gRPC or REST over a service mesh (e.g., Istio) for resilience and observability.
  - **Event Sourcing**: Store task state changes as events in a separate event store (e.g., Kafka or a dedicated DB), enabling auditability and easier service decoupling.
